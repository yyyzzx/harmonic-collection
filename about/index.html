            <br>
            <p>It is always hard to change from the usual and it is always easy to get worse, this is what I have always felt about developing good habits. Once they are established and can be driven naturally, not much effort would be required to maintain them. Intending to improve my health, I forced a different positive behavior into my daily routine for each week, trying to train my brain to do it unconsciously. However, a week’s length of time is definitely not enough to completely form a habit, it is suggested by <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.695.830&rep=rep1&type=pdf">a study published in the European Journal of Social Psychology</a> that it requires 18 to 254 days for a person to form a new habit. My weekly attempts would focus on the initial stage of building a habit and finding out the possibility of future long-term development of a habit.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Each entry documents the planning, process, and result of forming a desired behavior. The habits are introduced with their connection to me and my goal(s) and approach for the week. During the weeks, statistics are collected and made into table(s) and/or graph(s) to visualize target completion. At the end of the entries a short reflection talks about some of my experiences and thoughts about the week’s habit formation.</p>
