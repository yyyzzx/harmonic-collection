    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Due to lack of sleep, during school days with a morning lesson, I always feel sleepy and rely on coffee and tea to keep me awake. Although this seriously affects my health and learning efficiency, I never tried to sleep earlier at night as I have a strong addiction to electronic devices before bedtime. This habit then harms my natural sleep pattern by making me awake and energetic during nighttime.</p>
    <br>
    <p>According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, the age group that I am in, adult, 18-60 years old, is recommended to have 7 or more hours of sleep per night. When I have lessons starting at 9 am, I will need to wake up at roughly 7:30 am. If I am able to fall asleep before 12:30 am, I would technically get enough sleep.</p>
    <br>
    <P>This week, I will try my best to achieve a healthy amount of sleep for each day through various methods listed below and observe their effects on my sleep duration increase.</P>
    <br>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>  Reduce consumption of caffeinated beverages after 2 pm</li>
        <li>  Stop taking long naps (especially at weird times such as from 4 to10 pm)</li>
        <li>  Take shower before 10 pm</li>
        <li>  Sleep Aid Aromatherapy</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Statistics Collected</h2>
    <br>
    <p>By keeping track of the time I go to bed and the time I wake up in the morning, I made the bar chart below shows my sleep duration from 6 pm of the previous day to 6pm on the labeled day.</p>

    <h2>Daily Log</h2>
    <br>
    <p><div class="date">9/12 Tuesday 23:30~07:40</div></p>
    <p>Couldn’t resist a nap after my Interaction lesson. I was less sleepy but started to have a headache when I woke up, not sure why that happens to me so often when I wake up from naps.</p>
    
    <br>
    <p><div class="date">9/13 Wednesday 01:30~07:40</div></p>
    <p>Unable to fall asleep last night, maybe it's because of the nap I took, but it was only 2 hours long!!</p>
    
    <br>
    <p><div class="date">9/14 Thursday 01:50~10:50</div></p>
    <p>Today is the only day that I don’t have a morning lesson, so I stayed up late again last night…</p>
   
    <br>
    <p><div class="date">9/15 Friday 23:50~07:40</div></p>
    <p>Fell asleep last night reading my art history textbook, they can be such a sleep aid.</p>
    
    <br>
    <p><div class="date">9/16 Saturday 00:40~10:30</div></p>
    <p>The sound of children screaming woke me up this morning, why do they wake up so early, it’s the weekend!!</p>
    
    <br>
    <p><div class="date">9/17 Sunday 01:20~10:50</div></p>
    <p>Starting to give up early bedtimes…</p>

    <br>
    <p><div class="date">9/18 Monday 00:00~07:40</div></p>
    <p>Did technically got enough sleep, but still sleepy as I’m not used to waking up early after the weekend. </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The results prove that I am able to get enough sleep with the help of the methods mentioned above. The only day hat I failed to reach 7 hours of sleep was on Wednesday, and that was probably caused by the nap I had during noon on Tuesday. It was much harder to sleep early when knowing that I do not have to wake up early tomorrow, causing me to also want to stay up late the next night.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I have always considered the time after I start lying down on my bed and before I fell asleep is the only time I have to myself, the only time I am enjoying life, and the only time I surf deeply into the internet. Staying up late at night gives me illusion of entering a space with absence of the concept time, but actually I am just stealing the energy from the future version of myself. With this section of my day being reduced foe a week, I feel a sense of emptiness. Maybe late-night leisure time outweighs healthy sleeps? Making up my mind to give up healthy life could be the solution…</p>
