    <h1>Entry 1: Water Intake</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In this entry, I aim to find out the amount of water I drink daily and compare it with the recommended daily water intake calculated by a <a href="https://www.gigacalculator.com/calculators/water-intake-calculator.php">science-based hydration calculator</a>. The fact that I suffer from kidney stones and high uric acid (illnesses caused by/related to deficiency of water) reflects the importance of intake more water for my health. I hope that the process of investigating my current water intake will urge me to drink more water in the future.</p>
    <p>The suggested amount of water intake I got from the calculator was 1956ml. During this week, I would drink from the same 500ml water bottle and record the time I finished drinking each bottle. </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>In six out of seven days, I have managed to reach and exceed 1956ml of water intake; on average, I drink approximately 2200ml of water per day. From the statistics above, I found out that I do not start drinking water until noon afternoon, as I have the habit of replacing water with coffee or flavored beverages in the morning to make me feel less tired and sleepy. Forcing myself to drink water instead of other drinks would definitely make me healthier, but I guess this would be impossible for me to achieve.</p>
    <p>Moreover, I observed an increase in the figure during the first few days; this may be evidence proving that the method of taking records as a way of reminding myself to drink water is effective. However, it is possible that my water intake level will fail to maintain this healthy level and reduce after this week when I stop keeping track of the amount of water I drink.</p>
