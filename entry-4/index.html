        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Eating out and ordering takeout always costs quite a lot of money, especially in New York, one of the most expensive cities in the world. After looking over my bookkeeping app, I found out that roughly 30-40% of my money was spent on food and drinks (excluding buying groceries for cooking). During this week, I will try my best to cook at least one meal each day. To help myself achieve this, I started by uninstalling food delivery apps and kept reminding myself of the benefits of cooking:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li> Save money</li>
            <li> Improve my cooking skills</li>
            <li> Get healthier</li>
            <li> Have control over the amount and type of sauces/seasonings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <br>
        <p>After this week I have noticed my obsession with noodles, it is not that I hate rice, but I always subconsciously choose to cook noodles, maybe be its because cooking noodles is faster. I think that there is a huge improvement in my noodle-cooking skills and I am looking forward to cooking more dishes with different types of noodles.</p>
        <p>The difficulties I found out this week in developing the habit of cooking:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li> Trapped outside longer than 5 hours, usually between two lessons, unable to cook.</li>
            <li> Laziness in cooking leads to simply no eating, money saved, but unhealthy.</li>
            <li> Need to clean up the mess in the kitchen after cooking.</li>
            <li> Can’t get the smell of grease and food out of my apartment.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Overall, I think I have done quite well, I am still far away from cooking three meals a day, but at least I didn’t get sick from eating food I cooked, or blow up the kitchen.</p>
