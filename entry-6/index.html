        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Whenever the days get busy, especially during the school days, I feel that I am not getting enough exercise; The main and only daily exercise I get is walking when commuting. Due to the difficulty in forcing myself to do sporting events or go to the gym, increasing the number of steps I walk each day may be a possible way to get more exercise. According to <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-many-steps-should-you-take-a-day#for-general-health">Medical News Today</a>, it is recommended to aim for 10,000 steps a day, which is approximately 8 km.</p>
        <br>
        <p>During this week, I will try to develop the habit of walking as a main method of commute; instead of taking the bus, I will walk to school and walk back home.</p>

        <h2>Statistics Collected</h2>
        <br>
        <p>To demonstrate the changes to the steps walked per day, the data from two weeks before developing the habit, from the 10th to the 23rd of October, would also be analyzed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The table below shows the daily target completion of the three weeks:</p>
        <p>The figures in highlighted cells are those that have exceeded the goal of 10,000 steps.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="completion"><table>
            <tr>
                <th>Week 1</th>
                <th>4028</th>

            </tr>
        </table></div>
        <br>
        <p>To better look at the figures for each of the weekdays, the bar chart below was made:</p>
        <div class="img-container"><img src="images/barchart.png"></div>
        <p>The habit of walking only applies to days when I go out, on Thursdays, the only weekday that I don’t have any classes, I stayed at home for the whole day, so the figure for all three weeks’ Thursday doesn’t have much difference. Same for the weekends, the number of steps that I walked highly depended on whether I went out or stayed at home.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Factors that may affect steps walked per day:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Weather</li>
            <li> Time of day</li>
            <li> Purpose of going out</li>
            <li> Shoes I was wearing</li>
            <li> Entertainment devices(?) e.g. did I bring my headphone</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="reflection">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <br>
        <p>During this week, I have walked 48,701 steps in total, which is roughly 16,000 more steps than the two previous weeks. On average, I walked 6957 steps per day, which is still far away from the goal of 10,000 steps a day, but I am quite satisfied with the improvement made.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At the start of the week, it was difficult to force myself to walk to school, especially when the weather wasn’t good. I have to leave home a bit earlier and wake up from bed earlier when I have morning lessons. Overall, I think this a habit that I could maintain, at least till the weather becomes too cold.</p>
