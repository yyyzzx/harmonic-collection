        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I have always had the plan to take supplements to achieve better health. However, whenever I start to take them, it is always difficult for me to last; I tend to take pills less frequently over time until I completely forget about their existence. During this week, I am aiming to get into the habit of taking my supplements correctly. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Here are the supplements my doctor suggested me to take:</p>

                    <h3>Vitamin C</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>According to the <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/">National Institutes of Health</a>, “Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains adequate serum calcium and phosphate concentrations to enable normal bone mineralization and to prevent hypocalcemic tetany.”</p>

                <br>
                <p>Also known as 'free and easy wanderer'<br>According to <a href="https://treasureoftheeast.com/products/x105-c">Tianjiang Pharmaceutical</a>, “Soothes the liver resolves constraint regulates mood, nourishes blood and fortifies the spleen, spreads liver Qi, harmonizes the liver and spleen.”</p>

        <section class="approaches">
        <p>For vitamin D, I only need to take one capsule a day and the time of intake during the day doesn't really matter, whereas Xiao Yao Wan is required to be taken at a higher rate of 3 times a day and 4 pills each time. During this week I will take the following approaches to remind myself to take my medication:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li> Setting alarm clocks during mealtimes to remind myself</li>
            <li> Bring my pills with me when planning to go out for longer than 8 hours</li>
            <li> Keep my pill bottles in plain sight and within easy reach</li>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <br>
        <p>At the start of the week, it was impossible for me to remember to take pills. Even when I was reminded by my alarm clock, I would tell myself “ok, I’ll do that after I’m done with what I’m doing right now”, but then this voice would just get completely rubbed away from my brain. After going through a process of training my brain to remember when to take my pills, the action of taking pills then smoothly blends into my daily life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Developing the habit of taking medications or supplements correctly actually isn’t that suffering for me, because it doesn’t take too much time or physical effort, and the process of taking pills is painless. The difficult part is growing a long-term habit of taking pills at the correct times, to have a sense of autonomy in taking medication, rather than needing to be reminded all the time.</p>
